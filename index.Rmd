## Hi there! 

I am a master of environmental data science (MEDS) graduate from UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), where I learned to integrate programmatic geospatial and statistical analysis into the environmental field. The MEDS program has taught me to appreciate open-source learning and the value of reproducible workflows. 

My capstone project is helping to increase the accessibility and usability of the National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC) Snow Today website through web-based visualizations and in-depth and comprehensive Python tutorials for using snow and albedo datasets. Please use the "Capstone Repository" and "Technical Documentation" links if you want to learn more about my capstone project.
